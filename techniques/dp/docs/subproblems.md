# Subproblems

## Terminology

-   **Subproblems**: A smaller instance of a large problem

In DP, everything is about subproblems. We can find the subproblems for a DP problem by drawing a few cases out, generalizing $dp[i]$ for each step. A good strategy while finding the subproblems is to define the problem recursively, as that's the _only_ strategy.
