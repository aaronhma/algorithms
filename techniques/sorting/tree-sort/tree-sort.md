# Tree Sort

## About

Tree sort is a sorting algorithm that is based on the [Binary Search Tree(BST)](../../data_structures/tree/binary_search_tree/README.md) data structure. It creates a binary search tree from the elements of the input list then performs an [in-order traversal](#TODOUPDATE) on the binary search tree to get the elements in sorted order.
