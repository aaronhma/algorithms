# Shell Sort

## About

Shell sort is basically a variation of [Insertion Sort](insertion_sort.md) and the algorithm, from [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/shell-sort):

```diff
+ shellSort(array, size)
+  for interval i <- size/2n down to 1
+    for each interval "i" in array
+        sort all the elements at interval "i"
```
