# Counting

1. We can count how many numbers are in the list $1, 2, ..., 38$ easily.

2. When counting multiple events, we can multiply the number of ways that $A$ and $B$ can occur is:

$$(\text{the number of ways A can occur}) \times (\text{the number of ways B can occur})$$

3. We can arrange $n$ items in $n!$ ways, where

$$n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$$

4. We can select $r$ items in order from a group of $n$ items in $P(n, r)$ ways, where

$$P(n, r) = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times (n - r + 2) \times (n - r + 1) \times (n - r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$
