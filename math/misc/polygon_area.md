# Polygon Area

**$Area = (B / 2) + I - 1$**

where:

-   $B$: points in the boundary of polygon
-   $I$: points inside of polygon

## Euler's Formula

Euler's formula for Polygon Nets, which is a polygon divided into smaller polygons.

```
V - E + F = 2, where
V = number of vertices
E = number of edges
F = number of faces
```
