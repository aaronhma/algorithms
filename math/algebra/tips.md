# Tips

1. **Tip #1:**

> #### **Always convert decimals into fractions.**

For example, if we were to solve $2.5 * 0.25 * 1.\overline{3} * 1.2$, we would convert the decimals to fractions, then solve.

> -   $\overline{3} = 333333 ...$
>     In this case, $1.\overline{3} = 1.333333 ... = \frac{4}{3}$.

Let's solve the problem!

$$2.5 * 0.25 * 1.\overline{3} * 1.2$$
$$\frac{5}{2} * \frac{1}{4} * \frac{4}{3} * \frac{6}{5}$$

We cancel $5$, $4$, and rewrite our expression and find the answer:

$$\frac{1 * 6}{2 * 3}$$
$$\frac{6}{6} = 1$$

2. **Tip #2:**

> #### Multiplication by 11.

We can easily multiply any number by 11 using the following multiplication trick:

$$11 * 99$$
$$= 9 \text{ [some thing goes here] } 9$$
$$= 9 \text{ [9 + 9] } 9$$
$$= 9 \text { [18] } 9$$
$$= 1089$$

3. **Tip #3:**

> #### Any time we apply the square root operation on a number $x$, we have two results: $\sqrt{x}$ and $-\sqrt{x}$.

4. **Tip #4:**

> #### How to approximate $\sqrt{2}$.

A good measure of $\sqrt{2}$ used in the math community is the formula:

$$a_{n + 1} = \frac{a_n + \frac{2}{a_n}}{2}$$

where $a_0 = 1$. The next few terms $a_1 = \frac{3}{2}$, $a_2 = \frac{17}{12}$, $a_3 = \frac{577}{408}$, can easily be computed using the values from $a_n$ to compute $a_{n + 1}$.

5. **Tip #5:**

> #### A tip to solve math word problems.

In the AMC competitions, where word problems is a common type of problem, as it throws off a lot of competitors, a stategy that top mathletes use is working backwords. **In a lot of problems, the only information you can use right away is the information in the last few sentences.**

6. **Tip #6:**

> #### Checking your work.

**When solving math problems, STAY ORGANIZED.** It helps with checking your work. When checking your work, remember to **USE A DIFFERENT STATEGY THAN THE ONE YOU USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM** (so you don't make the same mistake that you possibly might have made again when solving the problem). Also, re-read the problem and make sure that you are computing the correct answer.

7. **Tip #7:**

> #### Convert the words into numbers.

When given a word problem, **ALWAYS** convert the words into numbers.

8. **Tip #8:**

> #### When there's multiplication and division involved, always perform the operation that makes the most sense.

9. **Tip #9:**

> #### When solving math problems, start by recording what you know in a systematic way. Then, look for a pattern that would simplify the problem.

10. **Tip #10:**

> #### It is impossible to create a non-cubical rectangular box with all sides having the same ratio of length to width. The only shape that has all sides having the same ratio of length to width is a cube.

Let's suppose that it is possible to find a $3$-D box that has all sides with width and length in the same ratio. We can choose a ratio that is simple to imagine, like $1 : 2$. That means that for each side, the following would be true:

$$\frac{length}{width} = 2$$

Let's draw one of the sides, with length $2a$ and width $a$:

Now let's consider a side that touches this side at an edge. That side also has a length and width satisfying $\frac{length}{width} = 2$. There are two options for the next side: either the edge $a$ can either be the "long" length or the "short" width.

The third type of side would be the top of the box.

However, you can see that in either case, the top cannot have $\frac{length}{width} = 2$.

The box top on the left has

$$\frac{length}{width} = \frac{2a}{\frac{1}{2}a} = 4$$

and the box top on the right has

$$\frac{length}{width} = \frac{2a}{2a} = 1$$

It's not possible to get a rectangular box with all sides having width and length in the same ratio. (If all sides have $\frac{length}{width} = 1$, you would get a cube, which isn't the same as a rectangular box.)

11. **Tip #11:**

> #### In competition math, knowing useful numbers is very helpful. Presented below are some useful, frequently used numbers that should be memorized.

-   $1001 = 7 * 11 * 13$

12. **Tip #12:**

> #### When taking a multiple-choice test that asks for the biggest/smaller number, if some of the options are the same, the biggest/smallest number can't be the options that are the same (they're tied - there is no biggest/smallest number).

13. **Tip #13:**

> #### Don't multiply until the end - sometimes, we can cancel terms. Also, this reduces the chance of any errors.

14. **Tip #14:**
