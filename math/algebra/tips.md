# Tips

1. **Tip #1:**

> #### **Always convert decimals into fractions.**

For example, if we were to solve $2.5 * 0.25 * 1.\overline{3} * 1.2$, we would convert the decimals to fractions, then solve.

> * $\overline{3} = 333333 ...$
> In this case,  $1.\overline{3} = 1.333333 ... = \frac{4}{3}$.

Let's solve the problem!

$$2.5 * 0.25 * 1.\overline{3} * 1.2$$
$$\frac{5}{2} * \frac{1}{4} * \frac{4}{3} * \frac{6}{5}$$

We cancel $5$, $4$, and rewrite our expression and find the answer:

$$\frac{1 * 6}{2 * 3}$$
$$\frac{6}{6} = 1$$

2. **Tip #2:**

> #### Multiplication by 11.

We can easily multiply any number by 11 using the following multiplication trick:

$$11 * 99$$
$$= 9 \text{ [some thing goes here] } 9$$
$$= 9 \text{ [9 + 9] } 9$$
$$= 9 \text { [18] } 9$$
$$= 1089$$

**[Does the multiplication of 11 trick work for all numbers? - YES](https://forum.poshenloh.com/topic/809/does-the-multiplication-by-11-trick-work-for-numbers-that-aren-t-two-digits?_=1619107946181)**

3. **Tip #3:**

> #### Any time we apply the square root operation on a number $x$, we have two results: $\sqrt{x}$ and $-\sqrt{x}$.

4. **Tip #4:**

> #### How to approximate $\sqrt{2}$.

A good measure of $\sqrt{2}$ used in the math community is the formula:

$$a_{n + 1} = \frac{a_n + \frac{2}{a_n}}{2}$$

where $a_0 = 1$. The next few terms $a_1 = \frac{3}{2}$, $a_2 = \frac{17}{12}$, $a_3 = \frac{577}{408}$, can easily be computed using the values from $a_n$ to compute $a_{n + 1}$.

5. **Tip #5:**

> #### A tip to solve math word problems.

In the AMC competitions, where word problems is a common type of problem, as it throws off a lot of competitors, a stategy that top mathletes use is working backwords. **In a lot of problems, the only information you can use right away is the information in the last few sentences.**

6. **Tip #6:**

> #### Checking your work.

**When solving math problems, STAY ORGANIZED.** It helps with checking your work. When checking your work, remember to **USE A DIFFERENT STATEGY THAN THE ONE YOU USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM** (so you don't make the same mistake that you possibly might have made again when solving the problem).

7. **Tip #7:**

> #### Convert the words into numbers.

When given a word problem, **ALWAYS** convert the words into numbers.

8. **Tip #8:**

> #### When there's multiplication and division involved, always perform the operation that makes the most sense.
