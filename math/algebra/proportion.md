<summary>What is a Proportion?</summary>

A proportion is just another word for ratio and fractions. A lot of times, people use these words to mean the same thing.

**Example 1: Two Fractions**

For example, $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}$ is a proportion.

**Example 2: Shapes**

When shapes are "in proportion", their relative size are the same.

For example, the images of head length to body length are the same in both drawings.

$$\frac{10}{20} = \frac{15}{30}$$

Now, let's say we want to draw a dog's head given the body length is $42$. Let $x$ be the length of the dog's head. Then, we can write the proportion with the help of the $\frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}$ ratio from above:

$$\frac{x}{42} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ (Writing the proportion)}$$
$$2x = 42\text{ (Cross multiply)}$$
$$x = 21\text{ (Divide both sides by 2)}$$

So, you should draw the head **21** long.

## **WARNING: In order to not get confused with proportions, always check your answer!**

## Direct Proportion

Direct proportion is the direct relationship between two quantities. In simple words, if one quantity increases, the other quantity also increases and vice-versa. For example, if the speed of a car is increased, it covers more distance in a fixed amount of time. In notation, the direct proportion is written as $y \propto x$.

## Indirect Proportion

This type describes the indirect relationship between two quantities. In simple words, if one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases and vice-versa. In notation, an inverse proportion is written as $y \propto \frac{1}{x}$. For example, increasing the speed of the car will result in covering a fixed distance in less time.
