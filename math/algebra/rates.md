# Rates

<details>

<summary>Rate</summary>

A rate is a comparison of two related quantities involving **"per"**. Often a second quantity is time (per second, per hour, per day, etc.), but it can be anything.

<summary>Unit Rate</summary>

The most popular type of rate is a unit rate of two quantities of a ratio such that the first quantity is $1$. When we compare a single unit quantity, we call it a unit rate.

**Example:**

- There are $60$ minutes in $\bold  \color{#399}1$ hour.

## Finding Unit Rates

To find a unit rate, we divide the first quantity in a rate by the second.

**Example:**

A plane flew $765$ kilometers ($km$) in $3$ hours.

The plane flew at a rate of $765 \div 3 = 255$ kilometers ($km$) per hour. We can write this as $\frac{1}{255} \frac{kilometers}{hour}$.

<summary>Tips When Using Rates</summary>

**Problem: A hot-dog-eating champion can eat $71$ hot dogs in $10$ minutes. How many football players (each of whom can each $31$ hot dogs in $10$ minutes) need to help so the whole group can eat $35$ hot dogs in $1$ minute? (_Note: Partial hot dogs add up, so if two people eat half a hot dog each, they contribute $1$ hot dog together._)**

_Answer choices:_

- 1
- 3
- 9

<summary>1. Try to use unit rates that are <b>in the same units (Convert them all into the same unit)</b>, it'll make it much easier!</summary>

* $1$ hot-dog-eating champion eats $71 \div 10 = 7.1$ hot dogs per minute ($\frac{hot \ dogs}{minute}$).
* $1$ football player eats $31 \div 10 = 3.1$ hot dogs per minute ($\frac{hot \ dogs}{minute}$).

This information is relevant to us, as if we have $1$ hot-dog-eating champion and $1$ football player, their rates add up! Together, they eat at a rate of $7.1 + 3.1 = 10.2$ hot dogs per minute ($\frac{hot \ dogs}{minute}$).

* $1$ hot-dog-eating champion and $n$ football players eats $35$ hot dogs per minute ($\frac{hot \ dogs}{minute}$).

This is why thinking in rates or speeds is useful, as we can add/subtract rates, and say our target rate is $\frac{35 \text{ (number of hot dogs)}}{1 \text{ (no. of minutes)}} = 35$ hot dogs per minute ($\frac{hot \ dogs}{minute}$) (what we did above).

<summary>2. Use an equation.</summary>

We need a rate of $35$ hot dogs per minute ($\frac{hot \ dogs}{minute}$) with $1$ hot-dog-eating champion and $n$ football players. This suggests an equation!

Let $n$ be the number of football players.

$$7.1 + 3.1n = 35$$

<details>

<summary>Side note: Generalization of the equation</summary>

We can also generalize this equation. For example, if $y$ hot dogs eaten every minute is not considered as it wasn't eaten according to the rules, we can change our equation:

$$7.1 + 3.1n - y = 35$$

This implies that $n$ here would be bigger than the original $n$.

<summary>Side note: Remove or not remove the decimals? & Prof. Loh's Trick for Subtracting Decimals</summary>

We can remove the decimals in the equation by multiplying by $10$, but for this problem, not removing the decimals is easier, as we can subtract $7.1$ from $35$ using Prof. Loh's trick:

$$35 - 7 = 28$$
$$28 - 0.1 = 27.9$$
$$=> 35 - 7.1 = 27.9$$

</details>

$$3.1n = 27.9$$
$$n = \frac{27.9}{3.1}$$

</details>

<details>

<summary>3. Estimate the answer (if possible)</summary>

In the previous part, we had the following equation:

$$n = \frac{27.9}{3.1}$$

<details>

<summary>Tip: AMC & MATHCOUNTS Tip</summary>

On a lot of AMC and MATHCOUNTS problems, the answer is an integer. On MATHCOUNTS, if the answer isn't an integer, it will tell you. On the AMC, you can see the answer choices, so you can guess the answer.

</details>

Since we know that the answer is an integer (based on the answer choices), the answer is $9$, as $\frac{27}{3} = 9$, and we see that $\frac{9}{1} = 9$, so $\frac{27.9}{3.1} = 9$.

<summary>4. Simplify (<b>Only works in special cases</b>)</summary>

In some problems, if the problem asks for a comparison of rates (eg. which one is bigger/smaller or rate $a$ divided by rate $b$) and it doesn't matter what the value of the rate is, we can simplify all the rates **only if they have a common factor**.
