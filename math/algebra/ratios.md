# Ratios

## Ratios are the Same if we can Simplify Them

If we simplify two ratios and they match, those two ratios are the same.

For example, $2:4 = 2 * 1:2*2 = 1:2$.

## Ratios Between Three Things

While we can't use $\frac{a}{\frac{b}{c}}$ or $\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{c}$ to represent the ratio between $a$, $b$, $c$ (which fraction is correct? -  both fractions lead to different results), we can use **ratio notation for $3$ things**:

$$a:b:c$$

This way of writing ratios helps us reason about multiple things that are all in proportion with each other.
