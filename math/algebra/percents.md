# Percents

## About

A percent is a part out of $100$. For example, $30 \%$ is $\frac{30}{100} = \frac{3}{10}$ or $0.3$.

## Common Mistakes

### #1

A shoe maker sells shoes for \$10. He marks up the price of a shoe by $30 \%$, then decreases it by $30 \%$.

**WARNING: The answer isn't \$10.**

The answer is actually \$9.1, because $10 * \frac{13}{10} * \frac{7}{10} = \frac{13 * 7}{10} = \frac{91}{10} = 9.1$ (this is $91 \%$ of $10$). (**We're representing the percent increases as fractions.**)

### #2

**WARNING: $20 \%$ off $\neq 10 \%$ off, then $10 \%$ off. $10 \%$ off, then $10 \%$ off is actually $19 \%$ off of $x$ ($x$: number given in problem statement). Note that $19 \%$ of $x$ is MORE than $20 \%$ of $x$. This is only true if we are performing $10 \%$ off on the original price, not on the price at each moment.**

## A Calculation Trick

$x \ \% \text{ of } y = y \ \% \text{ of } x$
