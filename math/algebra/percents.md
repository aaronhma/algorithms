## About

A percent is a part out of $100$. For example, $30 \%$ is $\frac{30}{100} = \frac{3}{10}$ or $0.3$.

## Common Mistakes

### #1

A shoe maker sells shoes for $$10$. He marks up the price of a shoe by $30 \%$, then decreases it by $30 \%$.

**WARNING: The answer isn't \$10.**

The answer is actually \$9.1, because $10 * \frac{13}{10} * \frac{7}{10} = \frac{13 * 7}{10} = \frac{91}{10} = 9.1$ (this is $91 \%$ of $10$). (**We're representing the percent increases as fractions.**)

### #2

**WARNING: $20 \%$ off $\neq 10 \%$ off, then $10 \%$ off. $10 \%$ off, then $10 \%$ off is actually $19 \%$ off of $x$ ($x$: number given in problem statement). Note that $19 \%$ of $x$ is MORE than $20 \%$ of $x$. This is only true if we are performing $10 \%$ off on the original price, not on the price at each moment.**

## Undoing Percents

> Undoing Percentage Increases

**Problem: What percent decrease will undo a $12.5 \%$ increase?**

Writing $12.5 \%$ as a fraction, $12.5 \% = \frac{1}{8}$, and add the original $1 (\frac{8}{8})$, we have $\frac{9}{8}$. To decrease this back to the original number, we multiply $\frac{9}{8}$ with its reciprocal ($\frac{8}{9}$).

$$\frac{9}{9} - \frac{8}{9} = \frac{1}{9} \approx -11.11 \%$$

This means that in order to undo a $12.5 \%$ increase, we must **decrease** by $\approx 11.11 \%$.

**Fun fact: The more we increase a number, the less we need to decrease a number. (For example, if we increase a number by $460 \%$, we decrease the current number by $82 \%$ to get the original number)**

> Undoing Percentage Decreases

**Problem: What percent increase will undo a $16.66666... \%$ decrease?**

We start by recognizing that $16.66666... = \frac{1}{6}$, so our number is reduces by $\frac{1}{6}$, which means we multiply it by $\frac{6}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$. To undo this, we should multiply the reciprical of $\frac{5}{6}$, which is $\frac{6}{5}$. That means our number increased by $\frac{6}{5} - \frac{5}{5} = \frac{1}{5}$, which is $20 \%$.

**Fun fact: The most we can decrease a number by is $100 \%$, as decreasing a number by $100 \%$ is $0$.**

## A Calculation Trick

$x \ \% \text{ of } y = y \ \% \text{ of } x$
