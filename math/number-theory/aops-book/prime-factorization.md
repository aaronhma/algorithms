# Chapter 4 - _Prime Factorization_

## Definitions

-   **Factor tree**: A visual chart that shows a step-by-step process of breaking an integer down into a product of primes
-   **Prime factorization**: The product of all primes of a number $n$
-   **Rational number**: A number that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers
-   **Reduced fractions**: a fraction in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $gcd(a, b) = 1$
-   **Unreduced fraction**: a fraction in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $gcd(a, b) \neq 1$

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important Things to Know üß†

-   The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that **every positive integer** has exactly **one** prime factorization.
-   The following statements hold true for any $a$, $b$ and $c$:

$$gcd(ac, bc) = c * gcd(a, b)$$
$$lcm[ac, bc] = c * lcm[a, b]$$
