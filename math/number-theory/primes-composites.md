# Chapter 2 - _Primes & Composites_

## Definitions

-   A **prime number** (aka **prime**) is a natural number $p$ where $p \geq 2$ whose only positive divisors are $1$ and $p$.
-   A **composite number** (aka **composite**) is a natural number $c$ with some positive divisors besides $1$ and $c$ and can be written as $c = a * b$ where $a$ and $b$ are (not necessarily distinct) divisors of the composite number $c$.

## Testing a Number for Divisibility

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Important: If a natural number $n$ where $n > 1$ has no prime divisors less than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$, then $n$ is prime.**

As an example, to see if $209$ is prime, we know that $\sqrt{209} \approx 14$. Then, we can test all the prime numbers from $2$ to $13$ ($\{ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \}$). After finding that $\frac{209}{11}$ results in an integer, we can conclude that $209$ is composite.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important Things to Know üß†

-   $1$ is the only natural number that is neither prime nor composite. It only has one positive divisor$-$itself.
-   For a prime number $p$, the smallest composite number that has no prime divisors less than $p$ is $p^2$.
