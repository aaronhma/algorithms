# Chapter 1 - _Integers: the Basics_

## Definitions

- **Natural Numbers/Counting Numbers/Positive Integers**: Integers on the positive side of zero on the number line
- **Negative Integers**: Integers to the left side of zero on the number line
- **Whole Numbers**: Integers that are either $0$ or positive
- **Perfect Square**: An integer equal to some integer $x$ to the second power
- **Perfect Cube**: An integer equal to some integer $x$ to the third power
- **Perfect Power**: An integer $x$ that is equal to some integer to a power that is at least $2$ (eg. $x^k$ where $k \geq 2$)
- A **multiple** of an integer is divisible by another integer $n$ when the quotient $m / n$ is also an integer.
- An integer $m$ is **divisible** by another integer $n$ when the quotient $m / n$ is also an integer.
- An integer $d$ is a **divisor** of an integer $n$ if and only if $n$ is divisble by $d$. Divisors are also known as **factors**.
- A **proper divisor** of an integer $n$ is a positive divisor of $n$ that is not $n$.

## Notation

If a number $m$ is a divisor of another number $n$, we can write that as $m | n$. For example, $6 | 18$, as $6$ is a divisor of $18$.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important Things to Know üß†

1. For any integers $m$ and $n$, their product $mn$ is both a multiple of $m$ and a multiple of $n$.

2. When $d \neq 0$, the following statements all mean the same thing:

- $n$ is a multiple of $d$
- $n$ is divisible by $d$
- $d$ is a divisor of $n$
- $d$ divides $n$
