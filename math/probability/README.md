# Probability

A probability is the measure of what chance some specified outcome has for happening. Generally, probabilities are either expressed as a percentage (from $0 \%$ to $100 \%$), or as a fraction ($0$ to $1$).

As an example, the probability of rolling an even number is $50 \%$ or $\frac{1}{2}$, since of the $6$ possible outcomes, only $3$ are even.
