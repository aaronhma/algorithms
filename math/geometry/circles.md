# Circles

## Circumference

The perimeter of a circle (known as the *circumference* of a circle), can be calculated with the formula below:

$$C = 2 \pi r = \pi d$$

## Area

The area of a circle can be found with the formula below:

$$A = \pi r^2$$


## Finding the Radius

The radius of a circle can be found based on the diameter.

$$r = \frac{d}{2}$$
