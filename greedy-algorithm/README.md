# Greedy Algorithm

## About

A greedy algorithm, as the name comes from, gets _greedy_ and chooses the locally optimal solution at each step, in hope of choosing the **globally** optimal solution.

**NOTE: There are very _few_ cases where we get the globally optimal solution.**

**Greedy Algorithm** is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.
