# Greedy Algorithm

[Greedy Algorithms problems](https://www.techiedelight.com/list-of-problems/#Greedy)

**Greedy Algorithm** is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.
