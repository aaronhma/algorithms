# Arrays

## About

An array in C++ is a static array that is defined upon initialization.

## Syntax

```cpp
int arr[50];
```

In the example above, we create an array of size $50$ (we can store $50$ elements numbered from indexes $0$ to $49$).

If we were to access the $6$-th element, we can access it with $arr[6]$.

**WARNING: The $i$-th index in $arr[i]$ must be an integer from $0$ to $n - 1$ where $n$ is the size of the vector.**
