# Angles

## Straight Angle

A line has $180^\circ$, as it is a semicircle ($360^\circ * \frac{1}{2} = 180^\circ$).

## Supplementary Angle

Two angles that add to $180^\circ$ are called supplementary angles.

---

## Complementary Angle

Similarly, two angles that add to $90^\circ$ are called complementary angles.

## Other Types of Angles

* **Right Angle**: An angle $a$ where $a = 90^\circ$
* **Acute Angle**: An angle $a$ where $a < 90^\circ$
* **Obtuse Angle**: An angle $a$ where $a > 90^\circ$ and $a < 180^\circ$
* **Reflex Angle**: An angle $a$ where $a > 180^\circ$

## What does $\angle ABC$ even mean?

It means we create the line from point $A$ going to point $B$ and another line going to point $C$. We then get the angle formed by the lines and that gives us degree of angle $\angle ABC$ (simply as $\angle B$).

## Exterior Angle Theorem

Suppose we have the following triangle:

The Exterior Triangle Theorem states that $d = a + c$.

## Parallel Lines Theorem

![Image](images/angles/parallel.png)

The Parallel Lines Theorem states that the blue shaded angles are the same and the yellow shaded angles are the same. This is correct because of [transversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transversal_(geometry)#:~:text=First%2C%20if%20a%20transversal%20intersects,then%20the%20lines%20are%20parallel.) - alternate angles have the same degree.
