[How to Compete in SRMS (Single Round Match)](https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/How%20To%20Compete%20in%20SRMs)

-   [Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) is Google's longest running global coding competition, where programmers of all levels put their skills to the test.

-   [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/) SPOJ is a simple website with tons of coding challenges.

-   [Kattis]

-   [Facebook Hacker Cup]() **January**

-   [Yandex Algorithm Cup](https://yandex.com/cup/algorithm/)

-   [Google Coding Competitions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/)

Code Jam and Kick Start are both like classic competitive programming, Hash Code you have optimization task for which the optimal answer may be unknown. Doing at least something reasonable is relatively trivial, but getting a good solution within a short round is challenging. You are competing against other people, and this competition attracts strongest contestants in the world.

Code Jam and Kick Start are both following a format that is different from Hash Code - it is more or less classic competitive programming, with some problems given such that it is known in advance that the solution exists, and usually your goal is to solve them precisely, or to get within some predefined precision/accuracy, while also being within specific restrictions on time and memory used.

## Challenge and competition

-   [KickStart — Google’s Coding Competitions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/about) offers programmer around the world a chance to develop their skills through online competition round. Each round lasts for 3 hours and they feature algorithmic challenges developed by Google engineers so that you can get a taste of what it takes to work at Google.

-   [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) A collection of mathematical problems made for problem solvers who are interested to combine mathematics and programming, Project Euler requires the use of mathematics to form algorithms and arrive at efficient solutions, and computer programming to actually solve it.

-   [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) is a popular coding platform that features over 8000 questions, 2000 challenges, and 1000 hackathons.

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is the best platform to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interviews.

-   [GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/) has tons of resources on programming and algorithms.

-   [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) is famous for being the place where data scientists collaborate and compete with each other.

-   [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a hiring platform that is the de facto for evaluating developer skills for over 2,000 companies around the world.

-   [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) Code practice and mentorship for everyone and level up your programming skills.

-   [Programmr](http://www.programmr.com/exercises) is an online interactive platform for anyone to learn and practice coding.

-   [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a well-designed platform where users work together to create challenges.

-   [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/) is to provide programming practice and knowledge sharing.

-   [Reply Challenges](https://challenges.reply.com/) is a series of challenges designed by “Replyers” and open to anyone who loves technology and online competitions.

-   [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/start) is to let programmers keep on improving their coding skills by solving the world’s most challenging problems, learn new concepts, and get inspired by the best developers.

-   [CodeGym](https://codegym.cc/) is an online Java Programming that is 80% based on practice.

-   [TechGig](https://www.techgig.com/) Learn, Compete & Grow.

-   [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/myfeed/)

-   [OJ.UZ](https://oj.uz/problems) From korea

For Olympiads specifically, check out https://oj.uz – it has a lot of Olympiad problems from various sources. You can order the problems by the number of solves; start with the easiest ones and go down the list. https://oj.uz/contests

Probably the most important thing is that you should get used to solving unusual (such as output-only and interactive) problems that appear at IOI a lot, but not very frequently in most online contests. Again, I would recommend https://oj.uz because it has such problems that you can practice on.

-   [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) DMOJ has monthly contests during the school year which are fairly good – although the problems aren’t always original, implementing “standard” algorithms is nevertheless quite important.

-   [Other competitions in USA](https://usaco-guide.vercel.app/general/resources-usa)

-   [Code Submission Evaluation System](https://cses.fi/)

-   [Internet Problem Solving Contest](https://ipsc.ksp.sk/)

-   [ICPC - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]

-   [IOI - International Olympiad in Informatics]
