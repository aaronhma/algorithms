## USACO

### Divisions

#### Bronze

**Bronze division** correspond to _CodeForces_ rating **< 1400**, and problems rated in between **900 - 1500**.

The general focus of the **Bronze division** is not on any specific techniques, but rather basic algorithmic thinking, mastery of your chosen programming language, and intuition and ability to think through problems.

##### Problem Types

Simulation, brute force/complete search, implementation, intersections of 2 and 3 squares, ad-hoc problems.

#### Silver

**Silver division** correspond to _CodeForces_ rating **1300 - 1600**, and problems rated in between **1200 - 1900**.

The general focus of the **Silver division** is applications of relatively simple algorithms. It requires a lot of ingenuity and more practices.

##### Problem Types

Sorting (ex: selection sort, bubble sort, built-in sort, Array sort, class array sort), prefix sums, linear search, binary search, graph theory (Depth First search, Breath First search), standard library data structures (ex: Stack, Queue, Vector, Set, Map, PriorityQueue), implementation, Simulation, ad-hoc problems, FloodFill, RMQ, Brute Force(Complete Search), String Algorithms, Greedy Problems, Recursion.

#### Gold

**Gold division** correspond to _CodeForces_ rating **1600 - 1900**, and problems rated in between **1500 - 2200**.

**Gold division** features a much wider breadth of material than silver, but less ingenuity and intuition, and a large number of gold problems are relatively straightforward and simple. The main thing you'll need to pass gold is knowledge of all the algorithms, and extensive practice.

##### Problem Types

More graph theory (DFS, BFS), shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), all-shortest-paths algorithms (Floyd-Warshall), minimum spanning tree (Prim), tree algorithms, dynamic programming (Longest Increasing Sub-sequence, Maximum Sub-array Sum, Longest Common Sub-sequence, Knapsack, Coin Change, Subset Sum, Edit Distance, Number Game), data structures (Fenwick tree, possibly segment tree, Stack, Queue, Vector, Set, Map, PriorityQueue), topological sort, combinatorics (PIE) and number theory, Bitset & Binary operations, Greedy Problems, Geometric Algorithms (Points, Line, Slope, Intersection, In-out of shapes).

#### Platinum

**Platinum division** correspond to _CodeForces_ rating **< 1750**, and problems rated in between **< 1900**.

The topics that show up on platinum contests aren't particularly well defined, and there is essentially no upper limit on problem difficulty. Anything is fair game (including topics explicitly banned from **IOI**, like heavy-light decomposition)

There are 4 divisions of the USA Computing Olympiad, and among those, platinum is the highest - about 26 of those contestants get selected for USACO training camp, and approximately half of these must be first-timers – the other half is usually the top-scoring participants and those are the ones that are mainly in contention for the IOI team. The campers do 6 more contests in order to select the team representing the USA.

## Tips and Tricks

Solving competitive programming problems consists of two parts: coming up with the algorithm, and implementing the algorithm. You should implement so that you practice both parts.

### What topics do I need to know for each of the USACO divisions?

-   Bronze (probably <1400 rated on CF, and Bronze problems correspond to 900-1500 rated CF problems.)

Simulation, brute force/complete search, implementation, intersections of 2 and 3 squares, ad-hoc problems. The general focus of the Bronze division is not on any specific techniques, but rather basic algorithmic thinking, mastery of your chosen programming language, and intuition and ability to think through problems.

-   Silver (probably 1300-1600 rated on CF, and Silver problems correspond to 1200-1900 rated CF problems.)

Sorting, prefix sums, binary search, graph theory, standard library data structures, implementation, ad-hoc problems. The main theme of the Silver division is applications of relatively simple algorithms. However, just because the algorithms themselves are relatively simple does not make the problems easy; in fact, silver problems require a lot of ingenuity, which makes passing silver a major bottleneck for many. Again, this is where practice comes in -- once you've done enough problems, you get much better at recognizing how you should attack any given problem.

-   Gold (probably 1600-1900 rated on CF, and Gold problems correspond to 1500-2200 rated CF problems.)

More graph theory (shortest-path algorithms, minimum spanning tree), tree algorithms, dynamic programming, data structures (Fenwick tree, possibly segment tree), topological sort, combinatorics (PIE) and number theory. Gold features a much wider breadth of material than silver, but in my opinion requires less ingenuity and intuition, and a large number of gold problems are relatively straightforward and simple. The main thing you'll need to pass gold is knowledge of all the algorithms, and extensive practice.

-   Platinum (probably 1750+ rated on CF, and Platinum problems correspond to 1900+ rated CF problems.)

The topics that show up on platinum contests aren't particularly well defined, and there is essentially no upper limit on problem difficulty. Anything is fair game (including topics explicitly banned from IOI, like heavy-light decomposition)

The goal is to earn as many points as possible. You should look at all the subtasks and try to earn as many points as you can. Start with the subtasks that you think are easiest and that you can solve, and just keep doing that until the end of the contest.
