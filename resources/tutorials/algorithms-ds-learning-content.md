# Algorithms & Data Structure Learning Contents

**Data Structure** is a collection of data values, the relationships between them, and the functions we can operate on them.

eg; tree, Linked List, arrays, graphs.
eg; insert, search, delete.

**Complexity Analysis** is all about Time and Space Complexity.
**Time Complexity** is the measure of how fast an algorithm runs.
**Space Complexity** is the amount of memory algorithm uses up.

**Memory** A variable is stored somewhere in the PC in memory. The memory is a bounded canvas and has a finite number of memory slots. The less memory a program takes, the better it performs. Memory is made up of bits 0 and 1.

Int in C++ = 32 bits = 4 bytes

**Pointers** are used to point to another memory address in base 2 format. (quickly point to a very far away memory location)

**Big-O-Notation**

We don't describe time complexity in terms of seconds. The speed of the algorithm is dependant on the input size. The same program may take different run time each time because of the computer's performance. But this is a very very negligible difference.

Time and Space Complexity is the measure of an algorithm speed/ run time when the size of input increases. Asymptotic analysis means that we are analyzing the behavior of a function as its value tends to infinity.

Big-O is the space/time complexity in the worst-case scenario. The unit of big-O is vague but can be defined as the time taken for one operation.
