## String tricks

Most of times, it compares string in [Lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20lexicographic%20or,order%20of%20their%20component%20letters.). In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, dictionary order, alphabetical order or lexicographic(al) product) is a generalization of the way words are alphabetically ordered based on the alphabetical order of their component letters.

-   `for(char ch='a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {}` Loop through each character from 'a' to 'z'

-   `min(string1, string2)` min and max in c++ will compare in lexicographic order

-   TLE, Constraints
