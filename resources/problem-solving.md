## The Invariance Principle

**Higher Problem-Solving Strategy**, the Invariance Principle strategy is the search for invariants.

The principle is applicable to algorithms (games, transformations). Some task is repeatedly performed. **If there is repetition, look for what does not change!**

In algorithms there is a starting state *S* and a sequence of legal steps (moves, transformations). One looks for answers to the following questions:

1. Can a given end state be reached?
2. Find all reachable end states.
3. Is there convergence to an end state?
4. Find all periods with or without tails, if any.
