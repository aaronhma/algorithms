## Generating Subsets

An example of recursion is generating subsets. For example, the subsets of ${1, 2, 3}$ is ${\emptyset, \{ 1 \}, \{2 \}, \{ 3 \}, \{ 1, 2 \}, \{ 1, 3 \}, \{ 2, 3 \}, \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$ respectfully. To generate subsets, we maintain a vector $subset = \{\}$ storing the current subset we are generating.
