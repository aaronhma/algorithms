# Dynamic Programming

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an programming paradigm that is like brute force,  but $efficient$.

## When do We Use Dynamic Programming?

To use Dynamic Programming, we must be able to divide the problem into smaller subproblems that we can formulate recursively.

## Memoization

The key idea in DP is memoization: after calculating a value, we store the value. That way, if the value is needed again, it can be retrieved from the array without any recursion.
