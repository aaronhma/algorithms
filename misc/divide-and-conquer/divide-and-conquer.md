## About

Divide and Conquer approach is suitable to solve a big (scale) problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems, where each sub-problem looks exactly similar to the original problem. In general, there are three phases:

- Divide - Break the given problem into smaller sub-problems
- Conquer - Solve each sub-problem using recursion. The smallest sub-problem (base case) would have a simple straightforward solution.
- Combine - This phase will automatically execute as a part of the recursion call stack, which combines the solution of smaller sub-problems to generate the final solution.

A **divide and conquer** algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type (divide), until these become simple enough to be solved directly (conquer). The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
