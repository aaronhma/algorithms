# Solving Problems

1. Don't panic!
2. Break down the story into a simple statement
3. Identify the standard & non-standard parts of the problem
4. Observice & prove properties about the non-standard part. If you can't prove them, then disprove. As you keep proving these properties, non-standard parts will start breaking down into standard, easily solvable parts.
5. Write and algorithm.
6. Find the solution to the test case.
