# Logarithms

The main thing we use logarithms for is solving for *x* when *x* is in an exponent.  ex: `10**x=100` => `x=2`

## Logarithm rules

These are helpful if you're trying to do some algebra stuff with logs. bringing a variable down from an exponent.

1. Multiplication   `log(b, x * y)` => `log(b, x) + log(b, y)`

2. Division  `log(b, x / y)` => `log(b, x) - log(b, y)`

3. Powers  `log(b, x ** y)` => `y * log(b, x)`

4. Change of base  `log(b, x)` => `log(c, x) / log(c, b)`  Useful for changing the base of a logarithm from bb to cc.
