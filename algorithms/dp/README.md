# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## About

Dynamic programming (DP) helps to eliminate the unnecessarily repeating the same result over and over again. Instead, it saves the result of every subproblem and reuses it multiple times to avoid extra computation.

## When to Use Dynamic Programming?

1. Counting something (eg. number of ways)
2. Minimize/Maximize value
3. Yes/No problems

## Iteration vs. Recursion in DP

| Iteration         | Recursion            |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Speed             | Easier to apply      |
| Easier complexity | Fewer states         |
| Shorter code      | Order doesn't matter |
| Harder techniques | -                    |
