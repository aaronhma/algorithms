# B-Tree

## Background

A B-tree is a non-linear data structure that is a variant of a [tree](../tree/README.md) which is always balanced.

**A balanced binary tree is a tree whose height is small relative to the number of nodes it has. By small, we usually mean the height is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes.**
