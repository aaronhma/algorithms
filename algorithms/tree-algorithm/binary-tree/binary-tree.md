# Binary Tree

## Background

A binary tree is a non-linear data structure variant of a [tree](../README.md) where every node has at most only 2 children, thus binary tree.

## Full Tree

A full binary tree is where every node has either 0 or 2 children.

## Complete Tree

A complete tree is a binary tree where in each level, except (possibly) the last, all the nodes are as far left as possible.

## Perfect Tree

A perfect tree is a binary tree where all nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same depth (or same level).

## Balanced Binary Tree

A balanced binary tree is a binary tree where the hight of the left and right sub-trees of every nodes differs by at most 1.

## Degenerate/Pathological Binary Tree

A degenerate/pathological binary tree is a binary tree where every parent node has only one child node.
